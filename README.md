# Gym-React-Project  

You can check the page here(hosted with firebase): https://gym-homepage-project.web.app

A simple design of a homepage for a gym service. It was created using React, JS, HTML and CSS. It's a one page design with a navbar, a few info sections, pricing options and a footer. App also reacts to mobile devices. 

### Navbar  

On the navbar we have the name of the gym along with the logo (taken from react-icons) as well as links to other pages.
